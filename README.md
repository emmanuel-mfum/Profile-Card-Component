# Profile-Card-Component
Frontend mentor challenge about layout skills

The challenge was to build out this profile card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I tried to build that profile card and get it look as much as possible to the original design.

This project required basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, espcially the grid layout system and containers
